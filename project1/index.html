	<h2>A Brief Summary</h2>
	<p>My name is Dominique Molee, and I am a second year Computing and Information Technology student at Rochester Institute of Technology. In the future, I hope to have the opportunity to work as a web developer, specifically in full-stack development. Aside from my professional goals, I enjoy photography, using tools like Photoshop, and hiking in my free time.</p>
    
    <p>On campus, I am very involved in RIT's Women in Computing organization, as I am the organization's student tutor and the director of logistics for WiCHacks - Women in Computing's all-women's hackathon. Additionally, I am also a Global Ambassador on campus for Croatia, as I studied there for about two months last summer. </p>

	<h2>My Mission</h2>
	<p>With this website, I hope to create a result that proves both to myself and employers that I have the potential to be a web developer, and have a working and strong base knowledge of both HTML and CSS.</p>
